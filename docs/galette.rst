Galette des rois recipe
=======================

`Galette des rois is good fun. -Julien`

Ingredients
-------------

* Two 25cm discs of puff pasty (check the frozen section of the supermarket)
* 100g / 3.5oz of softened butter
* 100g / 3.5oz of caster sugar
* 1 egg slightly beaten
* 1 egg yog
* 100g / 3.5oz of ground almond
* 1 hard element, like a coin or a raw bean, called 'la feve'

Preparation - 10 mins
---------------------
Turn the damn oven on right now! The rest is not taking long. 200C.

Put one disc in an round oven plater.

Beat together the butter, the sugar, the beaten egg and the almonds until you get something homogeneous.

Spread the paste on the first disc.

Put 'la feve' anywhere, 1/3 from the border, in the paste.

Put the second pasty circle on top. Moisten the border and press to stick the two pasties boreder together. Slice the top pasty to allow the galette to breath in the oven, try to make a nice pattern. Paint the top with the egg yog.

Done


Cooking - 30-40 mins
--------------------
30 to 40 minutes at 200 CELSIUS. The Crust must be golden, the core stays soft.

Consumption
-----------
Hot, cold, reheated, anything will do. 

For the super tradition: cut the Galette in slices. The youngest of the group goes under the table. For each slice, the person under the table announce who is going to eat it (not twice the same person, you silly). The person announces him/herself at one point. We all eat (get back from under the table stupid), the one that finds the 'feve' in its slice wins a prize (usually a paper crown).
